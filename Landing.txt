🎅 Welcome to Turbo Santa!

Your all-in-one setup wizard for routes, trackers, donations, sprites, and sleigh magic.

Before we begin checking your sheet, fixing issues, and enabling all the Turbo Santa tools…
there’s one important step you must do first.

🚀 STEP 1 — Deploy Your API (Required Before Anything Works!)

Turbo Santa uses your Google Apps Script as a live API to power your tracker, route viewer, donations widget, and more.

Please follow these steps:

In Google Sheets, go to Extensions → Apps Script

Click Deploy → New Deployment

Select Web App

Execute as: You

Who has access: Anyone

Click Deploy and approve permissions

Copy your Web App URL

Paste it into your sheet:

Settings → cell B2 (api_url)

Once your API URL is saved in B2, Turbo Santa can start working its magic.

🧰 STEP 2 — Launch Turbo Santa

Now click the 🎅 TurboSanta button in the toolbar.

The setup wizard will:

Scan your sheet

Fix common issues

Validate Firebase

Check folders, routes, sprites, donations

Make sure everything is connected properly

If Google Sheets shows a message like:
“Formulas want to send or receive data from external services…”
➡️ Please click Allow — this is required for live data, maps, tracker updates, and donations.

🎄 You're Ready!

Once your API is deployed and pasted into B2, Turbo Santa will guide you step-by-step.
Let’s get your sleigh flying! ✨🛷
