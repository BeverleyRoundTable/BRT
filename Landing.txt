🎅 Welcome to Turbo Santa!

Your all-in-one setup system for routes, trackers, donations, sprites, analytics, and full sleigh magic.

Before anything can work, Turbo Santa needs one key piece:
your API (Web App URL).

Don't worry — Turbo Santa now guides you through everything step-by-step.

🚀 STEP 1 — Click 🎅 TurboSanta → 💥 Deployment Wizard

This is always the first step.

The Deployment Wizard will automatically:

Create or update your Web App deployment

Request any missing permissions

Give you the correct API URL

Paste it into Settings → B2 (api_url)

Confirm that your API is reachable

Just follow the Wizard prompts — it handles all the technical bits for you.

🧰 If the Wizard cannot deploy automatically (rare):

Turbo Santa will tell you and provide instructions.
In that case, you can use the manual method:

Extensions → Apps Script

Deploy → New Deployment

Web App

Execute as: You

Access: Anyone

Deploy, approve, copy URL

Paste into Settings!B2

But normally, the Wizard does everything for you.

✨ STEP 2 — Continue through the Wizards

After Deployment Wizard is complete, follow any additional wizards you need:

Firebase Wizard

GPX Overlay Wizard

Routes Wizard

Donations Wizard

Carousel Wizard

RoadLookup Wizard

Sleigh Icons Wizard

Each wizard configures its own part of the system.

You don’t have to do all of them at once — only the tools you plan to use.

🏡 STEP 3 — Open TurboSanta Home

Your live validator dashboard.

TurboSanta Home checks whether:

API is valid

Firebase is connected

Routes, sprites, donations, folders exist

All required settings are filled

Tracker is ready

Thermometers + Carousel are correctly configured

Green means good — red means something needs attention.

🎄 You're Ready to Fly!

Once Deployment Wizard is complete and TurboSanta Home shows all green,
your sleigh system is fully operational.

Tracker, GPX animations, donations, carousels — all powered automatically from your sheet.
